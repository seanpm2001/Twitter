I haven't really been active on Twitter since 2018 November 3rd, and I have no plans on returning. I started using Mastodon on 2023, February 3rd. I am not very active on Mastodon either at the moment of writing this (2023, Monday, May 15th)

## Former usage of Twitter

When I first used Twitter, it was 2016. I was in my social media era, and didn't really create anything worthwhile, just morning, afternoon, evening, and night posts, along with something else from time to time. It isn't the most exciting account. I created over 10000 tweets in less than 2 years.

### Accounts

I had several (6) accounts on Twitter:

- [`@seanwallawalla`](https://twitter.com/seanwallawalla/) **Main account**
- [`@seanwallawallaa`](https://twitter.com/seanwallawallaa/) **Animation account**
- [`@seanwallawallab`](https://twitter.com/seanwallawallab/) **Business account**
- [`@seanwallawallae`](https://twitter.com/seanwallawallae/) **Electronic library account**
- [`@seanwallawallal`](https://twitter.com/seanwallawallal/) **Live stream account**
- [`@seanwallawalla2`](https://twitter.com/seanwallawalla2/) **"2nd" twitter account**

### Follows

This section goes over Twitter following habits

#### Follow for follow

While on Twitter, I did follow for follows. At one point, I had over 1.7k followers from this, but couldn't follow any more accounts, as there was a 5000 follow limit on my account (other people didn't seem to have this limit)

When going back to write this, I have noted that about 1000+ of the accounts I followed have been deleted.

#### Automatic follows

When I created my Twitter account, I was automatically followed to a lot of bad accounts, and I unfollowed the ones I could. Some remain.

## Since Elon Musk takeover

I had already been a dead account on Twitter for nearly 2 full years when Elon Musk completed his hostile takeover of Twitter.

### Salvaging Twitter open source on GitHub

**Context:**

This paragraph is modified from an old note dating to 2022 November.

Elon Musk bought twitter on 2022, October 27th and it has been getting worse and worse. I never expected him to run it well. Less than 2 weeks later, I found Twitter open source projects on GitHub and made a link list, but it was expected to start being worked with in December. I have been stressed regarding the idiocy of Twitters current management, and have feared that the open source part of Twitter may get shut down, due to all of the worker firings. I waited a bit too long on this. On 2022, Saturday, November 12th, I switched gears from [:octocat: `Atom`](https://github.com/atom/) forking to Twitter forking. I expect to finish within 7 days, then I won't have this stresser. Once I am done forking all Twitter repositories, I will go back to forking Atom repositories.

- 2022 November 16th: it is done

Side comment (2022 November 29th) I am surprised as to how Musk keeps shooting himself in the foot harder each time


### Removing links

I am replacing my Twitter social links with Mastodon links where I can. The main holdout is [:octocat: `u/SeanWallaWalla`](https://github.com/seanwallawalla/) where I plan to do so eventually.

### Account backup attempts

I had a small amount of data (estimate: less than 100 megabytes) of data on Twitter, and I have been trying to figure out how to download the data correctly, so that I can delete my account. After the Musk takeover, this project became a lot more hopeless.
